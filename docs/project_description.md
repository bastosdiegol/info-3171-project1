**Description**

This project involves two components.

1.       Create a UI Pattern Library for Data dashboards. (Project1)

2.       Visualize the provided data using charts and create a webpage with an optimal UI for presenting these charts. (Project2)

**Purpose**

On completing this project, you should be able to:

1.       Find and document the UI component that is suitable for the webpage.

2.       Analyze the data to identify a chart that can effectively represent the given data.

3.       Create a data dashboard using D3.js and display a chart that fulfills the client's requirements.

4.       Design a UI that is both efficient and clear.

**Overview**

This project consists of two parts. The first part is to create a UI pattern library for the data dashboard, and the second part is to create a webpage that displays the given data most efficiently and clearly.

**General Information**

1.       Assume you are a freelance developer, and your client wants to create a dashboard for their business.

2.       There will be six multi-value and three single-value charts that users may wish to display on their dashboard.

3.       Ensure that the dashboard aligns with customer requirements.

**Chart and Data Requirement for Project 1 and Project 2****

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Chart Requirements|1.       You must include at least 6 multi-value charts<br><br>2.       You must include at least 3 single-value charts<br><br>3.       Your dashboard should incorporate at least 4 different types of multi-value charts, such as bar charts, grouped bar charts, stacked bar charts, scatter plots, line charts, area charts, pie charts, horizontal bar charts, scatter plots, and stacked area charts.<br><br>4.       Charts should have an initial transition and transform on load – it should be a smooth transition.<br><br>5.       You should have at least 1 chart that can change data either with a **dropdown** or **text box**.<br><br>6.       You should create at least 1 chart that has **brush** functionality, and it should highlight the data in the brushed area<br><br>7.       You should create at least 1 chart that can be zoomed in.<br><br>8.       You should create at least 1 chart that has button/radio/checkbox to update the chart style (CSS)<br><br>9.       You should have at least 1 interactive legend.<br><br>10.   Do not use the same interactive legend from given example during the class – please think about other way to make use interactivity with the legend<br><br>11.   You should include at least 1 chart with tooltips for your data<br><br>12.   Ticks and Tick labels for axes are mandatory on all charts.<br><br>13.   You should include the chart name and axes labels for every chart.<br><br>14.   Ensure that your charts are easily readable; for instance, add labels or use methods that make them clear to readers.|
|Data Requirements|1.       You are required to render your data from the provided document.<br><br>2.       You should use XAMPP to render your data files<br><br>3.       Do not change original data<br><br>4.       If you need, you can restructure your data format using JavaScript after rendering your data.|

**  
For project1, you will need to analyze the chart requirements and acquire the necessary UI elements to be used in your project 2 chart dashboard, and you will need to display them in the pattern library.  
  

**  
For project2, use this chart and data requirements to create your dashboard.

|Description|Create a data tables or charts that can display the given data and create a webpage with best UI to show the data charts that you created.|
|Required submissions|HTML, CSS, JS, IMG – Zipped file|
|Technology You may or may not use|1.       Must use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript<br><br>2.       (MUST USE) D3.js for the chart<br><br>3.       Do not use JavaScript Frameworks. (Such as React, Angular, or Vue, etc)<br><br>4.       It is required to run XAMPP to render your data files.<br><br>5.       You are allowed to use Bootstrap or another CSS Framework.
